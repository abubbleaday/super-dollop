Welcome to my Data Science project as part of the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone.
We will be building a Machine Learning model to predict the profitability of a SpaceX competitor. 
We will utilize an API to fetch SpaceX data, as well as scrape the web for publicly available information. 
Join me for the ride.
